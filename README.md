This is a group project by six Master's students. We incorporated historical data to train the busyness level in Manhattan. 
The app is tailored towards car users who live in Manhattan. There are 600+ car parks to choose from! Additionally, there are 
other amenities, such as fuel and petrol stations. Below is the list of some of the features:
  -  Route from A to B
  -  Reroute through a fuel/charging station
  -  Checking the level of busyness at a later date
  -  Live news alert
  -  Set a radius around the destination to filter car parks
  -  Nearest car park recommendation
  -  Save favourite car parks
  -  Weather and 5-day forecast
  -  Rating feature
  -  Feedback feature

# Personal Contributions:
### ðŸŒŸStage 1: Data Collection and Preparation: 

I led in gathering and refining datasets relevant to traffic and parking in Manhattan, focusing on taxi data, weather conditions, and Points of Interest (POI).

### ðŸŒŸStage 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 

I was responsible for ensuring the data's quality by removing inaccuracies and irrelevant information, making it ready for analysis.

### ðŸŒŸStage 3: Feature Selection and Engineering: 

I identified and crafted features critical for analyzing traffic patterns and predicting busyness, such as time slots and seasonal influences.

### ðŸŒŸStage 4: Model Training for Busyness Prediction: 

I developed and trained RandomForest and XGBoost models to predict traffic busyness, incorporating both location-specific and aggregated data approaches.

### ðŸŒŸStage 5: Optimization and Regularization: 

In the later stages, I focused on refining the model through hyperparameter tuning and regularization to prevent overfitting and improve prediction accuracy.
